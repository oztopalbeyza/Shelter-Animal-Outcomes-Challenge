# Shelter-Animal-Outcomes-Challenge

This is a multi-class classification prediction project which aims to predict the outcome for each animal by using the dataset from Austin Animal Center. I mainly build tree-based machine learning models to get probabilistic predictions for 5 different outcomes which are Adoption, Died, Euthanasia, Return to owner and Transfer.

In the file named "code", you can see the overview of the dataset, exploratory data analysis, feature engineering and modeling details.
